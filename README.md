## Description

A first person tower defense game where you're a single guard with access to a select few of command towers. From said towers you have view of the roads and a dedicated section of stands surrounding the tower in which you can place automated turrets. Along with that, at these command towers you have your own turret to take control of matters if the machines don't get it right. Of course the road contain monsters, but be wary of the skies. A flying enemy targets the towers and if they destroy it, you will no longer have access to that tower, and no longer any access to the surrounding turrent stands. The goal of the game is to destroy enemies, from these enemies you get resources in which you can strengthen your defenses. The waves will come to an end; from there you can test yourself further by allowing extra waves to charge the gate and see how much you can take with increasing speed, damage, and health from the enemy.
